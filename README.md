## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-rendered applications
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and utility-first styling

### Backend & Infrastructure
- **Firebase**: 
  - Authentication
  - Firestore Database
  - Cloud Storage
  - Admin SDK for server-side operations
- **Vercel**: Primary deployment platform
- **Google Cloud VM**: Secondary deployment for staging/testing
- **PM2**: Process manager for Node.js applications on the VM

### Media Management
- **Cloudinary**: Cloud-based image and video management
- **TinyMCE**: Rich text editor integration for content creation

## Environment Setup

The application uses several environment variables to configure various services:

### Firebase Configuration
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID
```

### Cloudinary Configuration
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET
```

### TinyMCE Configuration
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINYMCE_API_KEY
```

### Admin Configuration
```
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY
ADMIN_EMAILS
FIREBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL
FIREBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

## Deployment Infrastructure

### Vercel Deployment
- Production environment with automatic deployments from the main branch
- Environment variables managed through Vercel dashboard

### Google Cloud VM Deployment
- Manual deployment using SSH
- Environment variables managed through `.env.production` file
- Application managed with PM2 for process monitoring and automatic restarts

## Recent Updates

1. **Environment Synchronization**: Ensured that all API keys and environment variables are consistent between Vercel and Google Cloud VM deployments.
   
2. **Firebase Configuration**: Updated Firebase service account key and configuration for proper backend functionality.

3. **Media Integration**: Added Cloudinary for image upload and management, with TinyMCE integration for rich content editing.
